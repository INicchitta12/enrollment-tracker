# Enrollment Tracker — project context

Single-page dashboard tracking Medicaid, Basic Health Program (BHP), and ACA Marketplace
enrollment. Published via GitHub Pages. Audience is internal policy analysts; the output
supports advocacy materials, so **figures must be defensible and conservatively sourced**.

## Layout

```
data/Enrollment_Tracker.xlsx   source workbook — the only file that changes monthly
data/pdf_history.json          national outcome mix Mar–Nov 2025 (from CMS PDF; static)
template.html                  page markup, CSS, and chart JS with __PLACEHOLDER__ tokens
build_dashboard.py             reads workbook + template -> writes index.html
index.html                     generated output; GitHub Pages serves this. Do not hand-edit.
```

## Rebuild

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # first time only
python build_dashboard.py
```

Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt` (pandas, openpyxl). In a cloud session,
install them before building. The script fails loudly if the workbook is missing or a
placeholder goes unsubstituted. **Never edit `index.html` directly** — edit `template.html`
or `build_dashboard.py` and rebuild, or the change is lost on the next run.

## Workbook sheets

| Sheet | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Mcaid` | One row per state per month, plus a `United States` row |
| `BHP` | Only DC, MN, NY, OR participate |
| `Marketplace` | **Superseded — do not read.** Kept for reference only |
| `Marketplace (2)` | The live Marketplace sheet. `Reporting Period` is the string `OEP` or a date |
| `Marketplace Feb. Effec. Enroll` | Two-letter state codes; needs abbreviation mapping |

## Data conventions that matter

**Marketplace post-OEP figures are effectuated enrollment, not plan selections.** The OEP
number counts plan selections at close of open enrollment; every later month counts
effectuated coverage. Different measures — label them distinctly and never describe the
gap between them as pure attrition. Confirmed by matching `Marketplace (2)` monthly values
against the effectuated sheet exactly.

**National post-OEP data is limited to reported months.** The United States post-OEP
series carries only OEP, Jan, and Feb 2026 — the months CMS actually reported national
effectuated totals. The workbook has no March figure, and its April value (19,200,000) is
a rounded placeholder, not a reported count, so both are excluded to avoid a misleading
isolated dot on the national trend line. The exclusion is an explicit, documented cutoff in
`load_marketplace()` (`NATIONAL_POST_OEP_EXCLUDE_FROM`), applied to the national series only.
State series are untouched — 12 states report genuine March, April, and May figures.

**Renewal denominators.** Renewed / disenrolled / pending are shares of *renewals due* that
month, not of total enrollment. Procedural and ineligible are shares of *total disenrolled*.

**The national outcome mix blends two sources.** Dec 2025 onward comes from the workbook.
Mar–Nov 2025 comes from `pdf_history.json` (CMS snapshot slides 17–18), where `pend` was
derived as the residual. The two agree within 0.4pt on overlapping months. State-level
outcome mix is workbook-only and covers the workbook's months.

**Outcome-mix components are rescaled to sum to exactly 100** so stacked bars render
cleanly. Adjustments are under ~0.25pt.

**California enrollment carries a continuity adjustment from March 2026 onward.** California
revised its Medicaid reporting in March 2026 to exclude limited-benefit enrollees and did not
restate prior months, making March-onward non-comparable to earlier months and inflating the
apparent national decline. To keep the trend comparable, `load_medicaid()` adds back a fixed
amount to California's `enroll` and `adult` counts for March 2026 and every later month (the
revision is permanent). The add-backs are derived by taking California's average monthly change
over Dec 2025–Feb 2026 (−106,996 total, −78,132 adult), treating that as the expected March
change, and attributing the excess decline to the reclassification:
`CA_ENROLL_ADJUST = 384186` (Total Medicaid Enrollment) and `CA_ADULT_ADJUST = 372782` (Total
Medicaid Adult Enrollment). **These are estimates, not CMS figures** — as reported, March
California enrollment was 10,715,787. The adjustment touches enrollment counts only; no renewal
field is altered. The national row is the exact sum of states, so national enrollment is
re-derived from state totals after the adjustment rather than adjusted separately, and the
sum-of-states identity is checked before the adjustment is applied. A visible note on the
Medicaid tab discloses the adjustment to viewers.

**BHP reporting coverage is uneven** — states report through different months. Charts plot
only each state's reported range. NY's figure is Essential Plan Expansion under a 1332
waiver, reported in the BHP series. National total uses January, the one month all four
states report.

**Ex parte** = renewal completed from data the state already holds, no beneficiary action.
It is the key operational metric: nationally it fell from 56% to 48% over 13 months while
procedural disenrollments rose from 10% to 15%. Across states the two correlate at r = -0.50
(n = 51) — a moderate association, so describe it as such rather than as causation.

## Conventions

- **Axis labels carry no decimals.** `axisFmt` picks its unit from tick spacing so narrow
  ranges don't collapse into repeated labels. Percent axes use `pctFmt`.
- **All charts route through `makeChart(id, config)`**, which destroys any prior instance
  first. Creating a Chart directly leaves a stale instance that state toggles can't replace.
- Medicaid and Marketplace tabs have state selectors; every figure on the tab recalculates.
  BHP is national only.
- No organizational branding on the page — it is publicly hosted.
- `noindex, nofollow` is set in `template.html`. Preserve it.
- Chart.js loads from CDN, so the page needs internet access.

## Monthly update

1. Drop the new workbook at `data/Enrollment_Tracker.xlsx` (keep the filename)
2. `python build_dashboard.py`
3. Sanity-check the console summary — month ranges and state counts should look right
4. Open `index.html` locally, click through all three tabs and a few state toggles
5. Commit and push; GitHub Pages redeploys within about a minute

## Verification habit

When new columns or sources appear, cross-check them against data already in the workbook
before wiring them into the dashboard, and report what matched and what didn't. Past checks
have caught a state-level off-by-one and confirmed that PDF-derived percentages agreed with
workbook counts within rounding. Prefer flagging a discrepancy over silently normalizing it.
